Coordinate systems available in math,
A person can read hundreds of math books..."

Human beings are good maintainers of information
However their expressions can vary widely
Mathematical functions, needs defining
Structure of mathematics, operators from there computation, encapsulation
Sharing encapsulated information, libraries

Virtual image in refraction, movies and games
Microscopes represent the mirror world of microorganisms, and so it is only logical that in a virtual setting such as in a game, we get different depictions and representations of them

Structure of mathematics, operators from there computation, encapsulation

Speculations
From the macro to the micro
Underlying structure of the universe, multiverse
When we see models of the solar system, which perspectivs are we speaking from, from an observational point of view, from a hypothetical point of view
Since interactions are taking pkace then this implies that at some level, the underlying structure has to  have a common basis
Then there's the zodiac
And all of these information about astrology
The hindu religion speaks of brahman, a metaphysical principle
And then there's the Internet
Upload and download of information
However for that, what needs to be downloaded or uploaded has to be defined properly
In movies we generally see a war between good and the twisted evil, who are working for some type of master
The evil have their own scripts to read, and there are indications that it is based on up  to date information
If someone is asking for a boon then it has to be defined peoperly
Using people as puppets, and on the other side of it, we see a variation of this
Video games
Microsoft cortana, sending info
